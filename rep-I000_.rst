Abstract
========

This REP proposes (a draft procedure) to combine Descartes(semi-constrained) and MoveIt!(free-space) path planning libraries in a ROS package. It is relevant for users who require a motion plan for a combination of both kinds of trajectory segments. This will be adapted in the future if the proposed Descartes ROS msg API is modified. The project is code-named Hamilton and the repository is available [here](https://github.com/ros-industrial-consortium/hamilton).

Motivation
==========
The motivation for Descartes can be found in rep-I0003. MoveIt! is the widespread used library for free space planning- especially pick and place. The idea is to give the user a hybrid planning library that allows an integration of both the capabilities and can be applied to broader and more varied use cases in the industrial robotics arena. 

Definitions
=========

Requirements
=========
* The library should take in a combination of several free space and semi-constrained paths and output a MoveIt! trajectory for execution. 

* Make the planner user-friendly : inputs should be easy to specify, and change for that matter.  

* The library should be general and flexible to accomodate possible use cases. 
 - Inputs in various formats
 - Methods to append descartes(Semi-constrained) and MoveIt(free-spaec) points/segments.
 - Add current pose(in RViz) as a free space or semi-constrained(ask user for the tolerances or axial symmetric axes and relevant descretizations) 
 - Functionality for simple curves - line, circle, etc for both types. 
 - Templates for common tasks - blending from Godel, other FTPs? 
 - Velocity at each point/tracjectory segment. 
 - Ask to specify interpolation type. 
 - All this to be done in a GUI. Goal/CP position, orientation, velocity, constraints/tolerances. 
 - Velocity generator methods.   

* MoveIt! has a lot of other functionalities as well. No one will use Hamilton if we provide only the above functions. 

* Incorporate Fermi. 

* Method to create a descartes robot model (as done in the ROS-I training classes for UR5.) Better (or other) options: 
 - Build over MoveIt! setup assistant. 
 - Descartes/Hamilton setup assistant. 
 - Maybe this is overkill, and this can be achieved by ROS plugin lib.(as done in Godel.) 
    
* Proposed Classes/Namespaces:
 - HybridPlanner
   - Constraints (inherited by PosConstraints, OrientationConstraints, VelConstraints, AccConstraints)
   - Descartes Process Path, Points(contains Constraints' object as member), Constraints. 
   - MoveIt! Free Path, Points.
   - RViz plugins. 
 - 
* Linear interpolator(from Godel::ProcessPathGenerator::addInterpolatedProcessPts)
=======
 - Constraints (inherited by PosConstraints, OrientationConstraints)
 - Descartes Process Path, Points(contains Constraints' object as member), Constraints. 
 - MoveIt! Free Path, Points.
 - RViz plugins. 
    
* Look at UT Austin's recent `ControlIt!`_.
