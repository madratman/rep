Abstract
========

This REP proposes (a draft procedure) to combine Descartes(semi-constrained) and MoveIt!(free-space) path planning libraries in a ROS package. It is relevant for users who require a motion plan for a combination of both kinds of trajectory segments. This will be adapted in the future if the proposed Descartes ROS msg API is modified. 

Motivation
==========
The motivation for Descartes can be found in rep-I0003. MoveIt! is the widespread used library for free space planning- especially pick and place. The idea is to give the user a hybrid planning library that allows an integration of both the capabilities and can be applied to broader and more varied use cases in the industrial robotics arena. 

Definitions
=========

Requirements
=========
 * The library should take in a combination of several free space and semi-constrained paths and output a joint trajectory for execution. 
 * Most robots supported by ROS-Industrial offer a FollowJointTrajectory action interface for both simulation and actual hardware. This is to be taken care of.
